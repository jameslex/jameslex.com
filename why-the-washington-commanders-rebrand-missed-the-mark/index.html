        <p>I received a lot of good feedback on <a href="https://www.jameslex.com/breakdown-washington-commanders-logo-and-brand/">my post about the Washington Commanders rebrand</a>. While the rebrand had some good elements, in the end I couldn't help but conclude the brand was generic and forgettable.</p><p>This morning I found the explanation from the company hired to create the new brand—<a href="https://www.codeandtheory.com/things-we-make/washington-football-team?ref=localhost">Code and Theory</a>—and I think I figured out why the rebrand missed the mark (and why they've already had to tweak the crest).</p><h2 id="was-it-crafted-by-sports-fans">Was it crafted by sports fans?</h2><p>Code and Theory sought to build "the most inclusive sports team brand—ever." </p><p>I’ve spend thousands of hours in the sports industry, and the only individuals who would use the phrase “sports team” in any context are non-sports fans. </p><p>If you're in the sports industry, you would reword the objective to something like "the most inclusive sports <strong>franchise</strong>—ever."</p><p>But if you don't understand sports, you're liable to think the 'sports team' plays the 'sports game' on the 'sports field' with the 'sports ball'....</p><p>Okay, a bit tongue-in-cheek. But they were aiming generic, and I think they hit the nail on the head.</p><p>Also, check out this new* crest for Washington. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.jameslex.com/content/images/2022/02/washington_commanders_badge.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://www.jameslex.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/washington_commanders_badge.jpg 600w, https://www.jameslex.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/02/washington_commanders_badge.jpg 1000w, https://www.jameslex.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/02/washington_commanders_badge.jpg 1600w, https://www.jameslex.com/content/images/2022/02/washington_commanders_badge.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Setting aside the design faux-pas of:</p><ol><li>Using three (or more?) fonts in a single logo,</li><li>Including SIX different years,</li><li>And designing a crest that does not scale down well at small sizes...</li></ol><p>This design strongly resembles <em>international</em> football, not <em>American</em> football.</p><p>Examine the Commanders' crest next to the English Premiere League logos.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.jameslex.com/content/images/2022/02/epl-teams.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://www.jameslex.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/epl-teams.jpg 600w, https://www.jameslex.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/02/epl-teams.jpg 1000w, https://www.jameslex.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/02/epl-teams.jpg 1600w, https://www.jameslex.com/content/images/2022/02/epl-teams.jpg 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The crest <strong><em>says</em></strong> "football," much like Liverpool or Leichester City. </p><p>A friend commented that the three stars in the Commanders' crest also resemble the three stars in the (very-American) Major League Soccer logo.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.jameslex.com/content/images/2022/04/mls-logo.webp" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2112" srcset="https://www.jameslex.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/04/mls-logo.webp 600w, https://www.jameslex.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/04/mls-logo.webp 1000w, https://www.jameslex.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/04/mls-logo.webp 1600w, https://www.jameslex.com/content/images/size/w2400/2022/04/mls-logo.webp 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Major League Soccer (MLS) Logo</figcaption></figure><p>But back to the Commanders crest.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.jameslex.com/content/images/2022/02/washington_commanders_badge.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://www.jameslex.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/washington_commanders_badge.jpg 600w, https://www.jameslex.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/02/washington_commanders_badge.jpg 1000w, https://www.jameslex.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/02/washington_commanders_badge.jpg 1600w, https://www.jameslex.com/content/images/2022/02/washington_commanders_badge.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Visually, this doesn't say <strong><em>American</em></strong> football because it's so generic.</p><p>Which, when I think about it,  fits well with the objective of creating an identity for a "sports team." 🤷🏻‍♂️</p><p>Lastly, you can tell this wasn't crafted by sports fans because....what happens to the crest if Washington wins another Super Bowl? </p><blockquote class="kg-blockquote-alt">If you're going to design an identity for a franchise grow into, don't make it possible for the team to outgrow it in less than a year.</blockquote><h2 id="the-knock-off-brand">The Knock-Off Brand</h2><p>In Code and Theory's design reasoning, they went to great lengths to explain that this rebrand is deeply rooted in inclusivity. In fact, they use the word “inclusive," or a varying form, 8 times in their brief. (By comparison, the word “football” was only used once when not referring to the "Washington Football Team").</p><p>The goal was inclusivity, not so much the NFL, football, or Washington DC. </p><p>But <strong><em>why</em></strong> inclusivity as the focus?</p><p>Well, the Redskins nickname was deemed not inclusive, and if you're going to go through the trouble (and expense 💰) of a full rebrand, you do <em>not</em> want to go through that process again.</p><p>At the end of the day, the emphasis on inclusivity is inseparable with the former nickname. </p><blockquote class="kg-blockquote-alt">This leads to the design philosophy being built around NOT being the Redskins more than it is built around BEING the Commanders.</blockquote><p>This is what I call the 'knock-off brand,' where a brand's equity is inescapably rooted in its imitation or rejection of another brand.</p><p><strong>And it never works</strong>.</p><p>Someone knocked-off YouTube and called it <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/FunMoney/story?id=3717066&page=1&ref=localhost">GodTube</a>. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.jameslex.com/content/images/2022/02/GodTube-YouTube.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1920" height="456" srcset="https://www.jameslex.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/GodTube-YouTube.jpg 600w, https://www.jameslex.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/02/GodTube-YouTube.jpg 1000w, https://www.jameslex.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/02/GodTube-YouTube.jpg 1600w, https://www.jameslex.com/content/images/2022/02/GodTube-YouTube.jpg 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Who wants to watch the imitation?</figcaption></figure><blockquote class="kg-blockquote-alt">No matter how good the content on GodTube will be, it's ultimately a knockoff of YouTube and sounds like a website where you're going to get three popup ads for hot singles in your area.</blockquote><p>Mike Huckabee's campaign for President in 2016 is one of the more recent knock-off brand attempts, where his entire marketing strategy centered around knocking off the well-crafted Obama brand.</p><ol><li>The rally cry "From Hope to Higher Ground" draws from Obama's "Hope" messaging</li><li>The logo imitates the horizon in Obama's famous O. </li></ol><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.jameslex.com/content/images/2022/02/Huckabee.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1920" height="456" srcset="https://www.jameslex.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/Huckabee.jpg 600w, https://www.jameslex.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/02/Huckabee.jpg 1000w, https://www.jameslex.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/02/Huckabee.jpg 1600w, https://www.jameslex.com/content/images/2022/02/Huckabee.jpg 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The Huckabee strategy meant that his unique identifier was that he was <strong><em>not</em></strong> the guy already in office.

The new identity has to be unique enough for the franchise to grow into over time but familiar enough to maintain the existing brand equity.</p><p>In execution, the Washington Commanders concept feels like it was birthed from a brief that stated, "Give us a new nickname, get people to forget we were ever the Redskins, and don't you dare touch our colors."</p><p>Ultimately, they tried to please everyone and ended up splitting the difference, which is why we're left with a decent high school or college brand that comes up short of encompassing the glory of one of the world's most iconic sports franchises.</p>
